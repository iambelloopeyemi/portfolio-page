        <h3>My Career So Far</h3>

        <main class="third_container">I have been an Internal Control, Audit, Risk and Compliance Professional for 4 years in the Financial Services Industry
            (I guess you can also call me a Banker). However, I have always had interest in technology and I decided to take myself up 
            on that interest. So, currently, I am taking the Front-end Engineering course at Stutern to make my interest generate interest
            for me.

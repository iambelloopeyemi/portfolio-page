          <h2>Hi there!</h2>

          <p>
            Sparked by the interest to develop the ability to build softwares
            that can potentially change humanity. I have the earnest desire to
            harness the necessary skillsets required and to continue to keep
            myself abreast of the latest technology that I can leverage to build
            useful softwares. Learn more about my journey below.

          <h2>My Career So Far</h2>

          <p>
            I have been an Internal Control, Audit, Risk and Compliance
            Professional for 4 years in the Financial Services Industry (I guess
            you can also call me a Banker). However, I have always had interest
            in technology and I decided to take myself up on that interest. So,
            currently, I am taking the Front-end Engineering course at Stutern
            to make my interest generate interest for me.
